Technically, Go is not an object-oriented programming language. It doesnâ€™t have classes, objects, and inheritance. However, you can define custom tyes with `methods(receiver functions)` as alternative in Go. For exmaple:

decks.go
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Create a new type of 'deck'
// which is a slice of strings
type decks []string

// 'd' is the copy of the variable of type 'decks'
// that has access to this print() method
func (d decks) print() {

	for _, value := range d {
		fmt.Println(value)
	}
}

// This receiver functions will return a variable of type `decks`
func (d decks) newStandardDeck() decks {
	newDecks := []string{}
	suits := [4]string{"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"}
	ranks := [13]string{"A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"}

	for _, s := range suits {
		for _, r := range ranks {
			newDecks = append(newDecks, s+" "+r)
		}
	}
	return newDecks
}


```

main.go
```go
package main

func main() {
	deck := decks{"Test"}
	deck = deck.newStandardDeck()
	deck.print()
}
```


Struct
-------

A struct is a user-defined type which contains properties that are related together. 
For example, we can define a struct `Card` to reprecent a card in a standard deck.

```go
// Create a new type call Card
type card struct {
	suit string
	rank string
}

// Create a new type of 'deck'
// which is a slice of strings
type decks []card

// 'd' is the copy of the variable of type 'decks'
// that has access to this NewStandardDeck() method
func (d decks) newStandardDeck() decks {
	newDecks := []card{}
	suits := [4]string{"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"}
	ranks := [13]string{"A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"}

	for _, s := range suits {
		for _, r := range ranks {

			// you can initial card via "card{suit: s, rank: r}" as well
			newDecks = append(newDecks, card{s, r})
		}
	}
	return newDecks
}

func (d decks) print() {
	for _, value := range d {
		fmt.Println(value.suit, value.rank)
	}
}

func (d decks) printWithField() {
	for _, value := range d {
		fmt.Printf("%+v\n", value)
	}
}


```

We can use struct in a struct as well. 

```go

type contactInfo struct {
	phone string
	email string
}

type player struct {
	name    string
	coins   int
	contact contactInfo
}

func main() {
	player1 := player{name: "Brandon", coins: 1000}
	player1.contact = contactInfo{"0987123456", "1989@TS64.com"}

	player2 := player1

	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", player1)
}

```

### Structs Are Pass By Reference
When you assign one struct variable to another, a new copy of the struct is created and assigned. For example:


```go
player1 := player{name: "Brandon", coins: 1000}
player1.contact = contactInfo{"0987123456", "1989@TS64.com"}

player2 := player1
player2.name = "Kobe"

fmt.Printf("%s\n", player1.name) // output = Brandon
fmt.Printf("%s\n", player2.name) // output = Kobe
```

### Comparation Between Variables of Same Struct

Because Go does not support overloading of methods and operators, you have to implement function for comparing two variables of same struct.

```go

type contactInfo struct {
	phone string
	email string
}

type player struct {
	name    string
	coins   int
	contact contactInfo
}

func (a player) isRicherThan(b player) bool {
	if a.coins > b.coins {
		return true
	}
	return false
}

func main() {

	player1 := player{name: "Brandon", coins: 5000}
	player2 := player{name: "Mark", coins: 1000}

	if player1.isRicherThan(player2) {
		fmt.Printf("%s has more coins.\n", player1.name)
	}

	if !player2.isRicherThan(player1) {
		fmt.Printf("%s has less coins.\n", player2.name)
	}
}

```
