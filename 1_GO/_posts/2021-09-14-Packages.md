title: "#14 Create Shared Packages Within A Module"
author: Brandon Tsai

Until now, We have only written code in the main package.
Let’s create a project that has customized shared package and see how to imports and use the functions in the shared package.


```bash
poker/
├── deck/
│   └── cards.go
├── go.mod
└── main.go
```

First, we implement the shared package deck/cards.go as following:

```go
package deck

func GetStandardDeck() [52]string {
	cards := [52]string{}

	i := 0
	for _, s := range getSuits() {
		for _, r := range getRanks() {
			cards[i] = s + " " + r
			i += 1
		}
	}

	return cards
}

func getSuits() [4]string {
	return [4]string{"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"}
}

func getRanks() [13]string {
	return [13]string{"A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"}
}


```

Then we can import the shared pakcage with path `<Module_Path>/<package>` in main.go file .
In this example, I init this module with command `go mod init brandon/poker`
so I need to import the deck pakcage with path `brandon/poker/deck`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"brandon/poker/deck"
)

func main() {
	a := deck.GetStandardDeck()
	for _, x := range a {
		fmt.Println(x)
	}
}

```

Exported vs Unexported names
----------------------------

Exported name: Anything (variable, type, or function) that starts with a capital letter is exported (public), and accessable outside the package.
Unexported name: Anything that does not start with a capital letter is not exported (private), and is accessable only inside the same package.
When you import a package, you can only access its exported names.

for example, in the main package, we can not call getSuits() and getRanks() functions because they are unexported. Only the exported GetStandardDeck() function can be accessed.
