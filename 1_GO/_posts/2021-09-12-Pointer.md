Go provide pointer similar to C and C++.

- Go use `&` operator to access the memory address of a variable.
- The the value stored in the variable that the pointer points to can be accessed by the `*` operator.

For example:

```go
var a int = 10

// declare a pointer that store the memory address of int variables.
// var p1 *int = &a
p1 := &a
// You can use 'new()' funtion to decalir a pointer as well
p2 := new(int)
p2 = &a

fmt.Println(a)
fmt.Println(p1)
fmt.Println(p2)
fmt.Println(*p1)
fmt.Println(*p2)

// Dereferencing. update the value that the pointer point to.
*p1 = 100
fmt.Println(a)
fmt.Println(p1)
fmt.Println(p2)
fmt.Println(*p1)
fmt.Println(*p2)
```

Compare Two Pointer
------------------

You can compare two pointers of same type using operators `==`, `<` or `>`.

```go
if p1 == p2 {
    fmt.Println("Both pointers p1 and p2 point to the same variable.")
}
```

Receiver Functions With Pointers
----------------------------

In a normal receiver functions, the parameters are pass by value.
With the feature of pointer, Go can pass the parameters by address

```go

type player struct {
	name    string
	coins   int
}

func (p1 *player) giveCoinsTo(p2 *player, payCoins int) {
	(*p1).coins = (*p1).coins - payCoins
	(*p2).coins = (*p2).coins + payCoins
}

func main() {

	a := &player{name: "Brandon", coins: 1000}
	b := &player{name: "James", coins: 5000}

	// declre a pointer that store the memory address of int variables.
	p1 := &a
	p2 := &b
	p1.giveCoinsTo(p2, 300)

	fmt.Println(a.coins)
	fmt.Println(b.coins)

}
```

In Golang, you do not need to declare a pointer before calling the receiver functions.
This means that we can remove `p1 := &a` in above example.
However, for the parameterm, we still need to decalre a pointer.

```go
	// declre a pointer that store the memory address of int variables.
	p2 := &b
	a.giveCoinsTo(p2, 300)
```
