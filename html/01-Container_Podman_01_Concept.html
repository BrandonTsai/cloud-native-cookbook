    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As you may have noticed, Red Hat replaces the docker daemon with
      CRI-O/Podman since RHEL 8.
      So what is Podman? According to the definition at <a
        href="https://podman.io/">Podman official website</a>,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and
        running OCI Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be
        run as root or in rootless mode.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Why does Red Hat want to get rid of the Docker Daemon? This is because
      there are few problems with running Docker with Docker Daemon</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single point of failure issue, once the daemon died, all containers
        died.</li>
      <li>This daemon process owned all the child processes for the running
        containers.</li>
      <li>All Docker operations had to be conducted by a user with the same full
        root authority.</li>
      <li>Building containers could lead to security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So Podman solves the above issues by directly interacting with Image
      registry, containers and image storage instead of work through a daemon.
      And the rootless mode allows a user to run containers without the full
      root authority.
      Besides, it also provides a Docker compatible command-line experience
      enabling users to pull, build, push and run containers.</p>
    <h4>Docker vs Podman</h4>
    <p><img alt=""

        /></p>
    <p>Podman interacts with Linux kernel to manage containers through the runC
      container runtime process instead of a daemon
      . The <a href="https://buildah.io/">buildah</a> utility is used to replace
      Docker build as the container images build tool and Docker push is
      replaced by <a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">skopeo</a> for
      moving container images between registries and container engines.</p>
    <h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
    <p>For RHEL7, subscribe rhel-7-server-extras-rpms yum repository and then
      enable Extras channel and install Podman.</p>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
sudo yum -y install podman</code></pre>


    <h4>Rootless mode?</h4>
    <p>Podman supports rootless mode, for more details to set up rootless mode
      on Redhat 7, please refer:
      https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/preview-running-containers-without-root-rhel-76</p>
    <p>This article will focus on the basic usage of Podman.</p>
    <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
    <p>Most Podman commands are similar to Docker commands. If youâ€™ve used the
      Docker CLI, you will be quite familiar with Podman.</p>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash"># Pull mage
sudo podman pull nginx

# List images
sudo podman images

# Run container
sudo podman run -dt -p 8081:80/tcp -v /opt/http:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro --name hello-nginx nginx</code></pre>
    <h2>Checkpoint and Restore</h2>
    <p><img alt=""
        src="https://darumatic.com/media/blog_pics/2020_01/container-cli.png" /></p>
    <p>If you running containers with <a
        href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/tmpfs/">tmpfs volume</a>, then
      export/import can not be the backup solution for that container because
      <code>export</code> does not back up the memory content. The files in the
      tmpfs volume will be lost when you <code>import</code> the container from
      the tar file. Here is <code>checkpoint/restore</code> come in. For docker,
      you need to turn on the experimantal feature to enable the feature. Podman
      can use these features directly without doing any change.</p>
    <h4>Run container that supports checkpoint</h4>
    <p>The <code>criu</code> package is required to do checkpoint/restore. And
      you have to add --security-opt="seccomp=unconfined" when running a
      container on RHEL because CRIU cannot correctly handle seccomp on RHEL7</p>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>sudo yum install -y criu
sudo podman run -dt --tmpfs /tmp -v /opt/http:/usr/share/nginx/html --security-opt=&quot;seccomp=unconfined&quot; --name hello-nginx nginx</code></pre>
    <h4>Create file in /tmp/ folder</h4>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>sudo podman exec -it hello-nginx touch /tmp/test-01</code></pre>
    <h4>Create checkpoint and export as a file.</h4>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>sudo podman container checkpoint --leave-running --export=/tmp/backup.tar hello-nginx</code></pre>
    <h4>Restore from file</h4>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>sudo podman stop hello-nginx
sudo podman rm hello-nginx
sudo podman container restore --import=/tmp/backup.tar</code></pre>


    <h4>Verify data does not lost in /tmp/ folder</h4>
    <pre class="codehilite"><code>$ sudo podman exec -it hello-nginx ls /tmp/test-01
/tmp/test-01</code></pre>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As the replacement of Docker, Podman provides the same developer
      experience as Docker while doing things in a slightly more secure way in
      the background. You could alias Docker with Podman and never notice that
      there is a completely different tool for managing your local containers.
      Besides, with the daemonless design and the rootless mode, Podman is a bit
      more isolated and more secure to use than Docker. You should consider
      using Podman instead of installing Docker-ce on your local machine.</p>
