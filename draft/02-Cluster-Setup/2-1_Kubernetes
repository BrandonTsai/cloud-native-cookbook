For production environment, it is strongly recommend to run containers on Kubernetes/Openshift instead of running on VM directly.


While Docker provided an open standard for packaging and distributing containerized applications, there are some problems.

- How would all of these containers be coordinated and scheduled?
- How do you seamlessly upgrade an application without any interruption of service?
- How do you monitor the health of an application, know when something goes wrong and seamlessly restart it?

Openshift is a comprehensive system for automating deployment, scheduling and scaling of containerized applications.
