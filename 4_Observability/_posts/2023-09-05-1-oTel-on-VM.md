Steps to Monitor Docker Containers with OpenTelemetry
=============================================================

1. Install OpenTelemetry Collector

- Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector either as a standalone agent on the VM or as a containerized service within the Docker environment.
- The collector is responsible for collecting telemetry data from your containers and exporting it to the desired backend (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, or Splunk).

2. Instrument the Application

- Use OpenTelemetry libraries or SDKs to instrument the application running inside the container. This ensures that the application generates traces, metrics, and logs.
- For supported languages, use auto-instrumentation to minimize manual effort.

3. Set Up Container Monitoring

- Metrics: Use OpenTelemetry's metrics SDK to collect container-specific metrics, such as CPU, memory usage, and network statistics.
  - Alternatively, tools like cAdvisor can export container metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
- Logs: Configure OpenTelemetry to collect logs from the container. Use log drivers like Fluentd or Fluent Bit for advanced log processing.
- Traces: Configure distributed tracing in the application and route the trace data to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

1. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector

Create a configuration file for the OpenTelemetry Collector that defines:

- Receivers: To accept telemetry data (e.g., OTLP, Prometheus).
- Processors: To process or enrich telemetry data.
- Exporters: To send data to your preferred observability backend.


Example (Minimal YAML Config):

```
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:
exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8888"
  logging:
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: []
      exporters: [prometheus, logging]
```

5. Export Data to a Backend

Choose an observability backend to visualize and analyze the telemetry data:
- Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana, Cloud Monitoring services.
- Logs: Splunk, ELK stack.
- Traces: Jaeger, Zipkin.



Collecting Metrics and Logs from a VM with OpenTelemetry
=====================================================

1. Collecting Metrics

- Use the OpenTelemetry Collector to gather system-level metrics from the VM. The OpenTelemetry Collector has built-in integrations for system metrics collection, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk IO, and network traffic.
- Configure the Host Metrics Receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.


```YAML
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 60s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      memory:
      disk:
      filesystem:
      network:
exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8888"
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      exporters: [prometheus]
```

2. Collecting Logs from /var/log

- Use the `Filelog` Receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector to ingest logs from specific files or directories like /var/log.

```YAML
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /var/log/*.log
    start_at: end
    operators:
      - type: regex_parser
        regex: '^(?P<timestamp>\S+) (?P<log_level>\S+) (?P<message>.*)$'
        parse_from: body
        timestamp:
          parse_from: timestamp
          layout: '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'
exporters:
  logging:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "your-backend-endpoint"
service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [filelog]
      exporters: [logging, otlp]
```


2. Collecting Logs from Journald

- Since journald stores logs in a binary format and not as plain text files, youâ€™ll typically need to use tools or libraries capable of reading journald entries.
- Using `Journald Receiver`, please refer https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/journaldreceiver
