Introduction
============

Your application is starting up okay, but how can you monitor it to know whether it is actually ready to handle requests? Even if it starts out handling requests okay, how can you know whether it fails at some point and stops handling new requests? This is where high-level application health checks come in.
Three primary types of health checks are provided: livenessProbe, readinessProbe  and startupProbe.
